                Please just go travel <em>somewhere</em>, like anywhere. Take time off and stop working and living in a stupid box near all your stupid neighbors. 
                Go see cool shit instead of the same old boring shit. They have iced coffee literally everywhere. Thats not an excuse. 
                Go drink iced fucking coffee on an island, or on a roadtrip or even in a new city. It will be cool. You will like it, I promise.
